                    <p>
                        In 2007 BRO performed the Beethoven Triple Concerto with visiting Seraphim Trio from Melbourne.
                        The orchestra repeated the concert in Cairns with no Cyclone Larry this time!
                        A string ensemble drawn from the larger orchestra was invited by Piers Lane
                        the new Director of the AFCM, to perform for the first time in the Australian
                        Festival of Chamber Music, accompanying Australian Opera Baritone Peter Coleman-Wright,a very successful concert.
                        The Governor of Queensland became the patron of the Orchestra joining the founding patron Professor
                        John Hopkins to inspire the further development of the orchestra and the year culminated in a sell out
                        concert featuring James Morrison, conductor Sean O"Boyle, jazz vocalist Emma Pask and a collaboration
                        with Townsville Brass and the rythym section from the amazing 1 RAR Band. The event of the year!

                    <h1>2009</h1>
                    <p>
                        2009 was a year of highs and lows for the Barrier Reef Orchestra.Our first concert in March was conducted
                        by Richard McIntyre but we had pre-concert drama as our soloist had to retire due to injury. We fortunately
                        were able to get Marcus Stocker at the last minute to play the Dvorak concerto. The program of Dvorak and
                        Sibelius challenged the orchestra but the challenge and drama became greater due to the failure of the airconditioning at Riverway.
                        With the venue getting hotter and hotter during rehearsal we had to decide whether to go ahead or cancel
                        the event. We decided to go ahead and most of our loyal audience stayed with us but it was hard going. Rick who is from cold Canberra certainly got a feel of the tropics that night as did everyone that attended.
                        Our mid year concert had to be cancelled due to the majority of the orchestra going away for a music camp.
                        Very few cities the size of Townsville attempt to produce an orchestra and while Townsville is musically
                        very strong we certainly stretched the music fraternity too far at that time.
                        Our October concert was to feature Ji Won Kim who had won the previous Australian Vocal and Concerto
                        Competition here in Townsville. However, her blossoming career had her overseas at the time, and made
                        her unavailable for that concert. She has since gone on to win the ABC’s Young Performer of the Year Award. We now look forward to hearing her play in our next concert in March 2010.
                        Our guest conductor Sean O’Boyle knew the perfect singers to do a “Last Night at the Proms” concert.
                        This concert was a great success! It featured the Townsville Oratorio Choir, the full orchestra, Sean O’Boyle
                        conducting and also included guest piper, Ray Sutton, guest tenor, Gregory Moore and Canadian soprano,
                        Suzanne Kompass at the Civic Theatre.
